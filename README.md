# Gambit

This is a student project for the University of Washington Games Capstone (CSE 481D)

Gambit is a story-based card and strategy game. The player is hell-bent on getting revenge against a mafia family that has wronged them and their revenge takes the form of running their casino dry. The player has to balance winning money out of the casino while not raising the mafia family's suspicion against them. The player must make choices in NPC interactions to form alliances that affect the outcome of the game's story while also choosing what is best for their interests of beating the casino once and for all.
